# Scans a codebase for TODO comments and displays them sorted by date.
#
# Pretty handy for those of us who spam TODOs all over the place but easily lose track of them.
# Comments should be in the following format:
#   // TODO(2020-12-15): Fix rendering bug
#
# The output of this program is meant to be fed into vim's quickfix list. Vim abbreviations can make
# the date insertion automatic.
