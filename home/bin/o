# Swiss army knife file opener.
#
# How is this different than xdg-open/mimeopen?
# - Can open multiple files at once, eg: o *.jpg
# - Handles terminal window tabbing (swallowing)
# - Doesn't fork a new process and terminal apps are run in the same terminal
# - Doesn't hide the program's stdout/stderr
# - Correctly handles weird filenames, including starting with a hyphen
# - Special handling for viewing markdown and other documents
# - Is easier to type :)
