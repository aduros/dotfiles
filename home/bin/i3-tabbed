# Splits the current terminal into a tab layout, runs a command, then restores the original layout.
# Handy for opening images and videos "inside" a terminal.

# To be super minimal, configure i3 to use a 0px font size to hide the tab title bars. With the
# unfortunate caveat that this will cause i3 error messages to become unreadable.
